    "In this assignment, we will explore XML files encoded in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format. TEI is a widely used standard for representing texts in digital form, particularly in the humanities. TEI files are XML files that contain rich metadata and structural information about texts, making them suitable for various types of analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **access**: downloading, storing, reading, processing XML files\n",
    "* **analysis**: performing basic quantitative and qualitative analysis of XML files\n",
    "* **interpretation**: exploring the meaning and utility of XML files from both analytical and creative perspectives \n",
    "\n",
    "As we deal with these files, we will make use of lxml.etree for XML parsing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "XML files are guided by **markup rules**, which you can read more about [here](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp) and consist of **elements**, which you can dive into [here](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp).\n",
